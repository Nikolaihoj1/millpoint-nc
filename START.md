# How to Start the Frontend Preview

## Quick Start

1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser to the URL shown (typically `http://localhost:5173`)

## Troubleshooting

If you see an error about `package.json` not found, make sure you're in the `frontend` directory:

```bash
# From the project root
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## What You'll See

Once the server starts, you'll see a modern NC Program Management interface with:
- Dashboard with system metrics
- NC Programs list (searchable and filterable)
- Program detail views with NC code
- Setup sheet examples with mobile capture mockups
