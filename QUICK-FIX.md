# Quick Fix - Frontend Preview

The errors you saw were because:
1. React dependencies weren't installed yet
2. Tailwind v4 had a breaking change

## ✅ Fixed! Now run this:

**In your terminal (make sure you're in the `frontend` directory):**

```bash
npm install
```

Wait for it to complete, then:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🎉 What This Will Do

1. Install React and React-DOM
2. Install the correct Tailwind CSS version (v3)
3. Install the Vite React plugin
4. Start the development server

## 🌐 Then Open Your Browser

Once you see:
```
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

Open that URL in your browser!

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

If you're not in the frontend folder, run:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

**Or use the startup script from the project root:**
```bash
start-frontend.bat
```
